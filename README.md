# The main objective of this project is to list different places and show tapped place on a Map along with the user location.

To achieve this I have used recycler view to list out the places received from the URL. Used Volley framework 
to handle network operations.

To render Maps I have used MapBox Android SDK. The architecture used is MVVM with LiveData developed using Kotlin. There are three pages
to render right information
1) Splash Screen.
2) List Page (Activity) - To display place details in Card view format
3) Map Page (Activity) -  To display Map view.

I started working on Wednesday evening and wrapped it up by Sunday.
